# GitHub CLI Cheatsheet

## Introduction

Everyone is becoming an AI engineer these days ‚Äì some of us are just doing it more quickly than others. 

If you've arrived in the AI space without a traditional engineering background, then using GitHub is likely a new skill for you. GitHub is essential for development projects, and even if you're not an expert, there are a few things you should know.

GitHub is where most of the engineering world manages their software projects. It's how we do version control (v1, v2, v3, etc.), work on one feature at a time without breaking the whole app, collaborate with others, and more.

**TL;DR:** If you are coding (even without AI), you will end up using GitHub.

## Why Use GitHub CLI?

You'll generally develop on your own computer, and once your software reaches a good place (working without bugs), you'll want to "push it" to GitHub.

The easiest way to do this is with **GitHub CLI** (Command Line Interface):
- It's what you see hackers using in movies ‚Äì a black interface with text
- On Mac, the native CLI app is called Terminal
- On Windows, it's Windows Terminal

While tools like GitHub MCP offer an easier option, knowing the basics is essential for approving commands when AI makes changes to your codebase.

## Tips for Success

1. **Commit often** - Small, frequent commits are better than large, infrequent ones
2. **Write clear commit messages** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Pull before you push** - Always get the latest changes first
4. **Create branches for features** - Don't work directly on main
5. **Double-check before hard resets** - These actions can't be easily undone
